devdocs.el is a documentation viewer for Emacs similar to the built-in
Info browser, but geared towards documentation obtained from the
[[https://devdocs.io][DevDocs]] website.  The stable version is available from [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/devdocs.html][GNU ELPA]] and a
development version is available from [[https://melpa.org/#/devdocs][MELPA]]; to install, type =M-x
package-install RET devdocs=.

To get started, download some documentation with =M-x
devdocs-install=.  This will first query https://devdocs.io for the
available documents and save the selected one to disk.  Once you have
the desired documents at hand, call =M-x devdocs-lookup= to search for
entries.

In any given buffer, the first call to =devdocs-lookup= will query for
a list of documents to search (you can select more than one option by
entering a comma-separated list).  This selection will be remembered
in subsequent calls to =devdocs-lookup=, unless a prefix argument is
given; in this case you can select a new list of documents.
Alternatively, you can set the =devdocs-current-docs= variable
directly, say via [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Directory-Variables.html][dir-local variables]] or a mode hook:

#+begin_src elisp
  (add-hook 'python-mode-hook
            (lambda () (setq-local devdocs-current-docs '("python~3.9"))))
#+end_src

In the =*devdocs*= buffer, navigation keys similar to Info and
=*Help*= buffers are available; press =C-h m= for details.  Internal
hyperlinks are opened in the same viewing buffer, and external links
are opened as =browse-url= normally would.

** Use package

If you use use-package, a =devdocs= keyword is provided that will ensure
documentation is installed and configure the =devdocs-current-docs= variable.

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package python :devdocs (python-mode "python~3.9"))
#+end_src

This will call =devdocs-install= to install the =python~3.9= documentation if it
is not already installed and add a hook to set =devdocs-current-docs= to
='("python~3.9")= for =python-mode=.

** Contributing

Discussions, suggestions and code contributions are welcome! Since
this package is part of GNU ELPA, nontrivial contributions (above 15
lines of code) require a copyright assignment to the FSF.
